# Overview

This repository is a collection of guides designed to help refresh or give a brief overview on various statistics, linear algebra, machine learning, and computer science topics. These guides are mainly created as memory boosters for myself; however, I am making them public in case anybody would like to read them. 

## Prerequisite knowledge

These guides begin with the assumption that one has a firm handle on:
- Multivariate calculus with at least some understanding of matrix calculus
- The basics of linear algebra (dot product, cross product, cosine distance, vector & matrix algebra etc...)
- The basics of statistical theory (bernoulli trials, distributions, central limit theorem, etc...)
- Basic understanding of mathematical notation (I typically provide a reminder for non standard symbols)
